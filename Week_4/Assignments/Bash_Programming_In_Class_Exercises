Bash Programming In Class Exercises

In the Data directory for this week, I have provided you with a file called "pseudo_metadata.csv". This file contains some fake meta data for a small study of 10 participants. 

1) Count how many lines are in this file.

2) Subset this data frame to contain only the female participants and write out that meta data to a file called "only_female.txt".

3) Make a new directory called "new_dir". Copy the "females_metadata.csv" into your new directory. Make a new file called "notes.txt" in this directory. Write a few notes on the data in the "females_metadata.csv".


4) Isolate the third and fourth columns in the data frame and write that out to a new file called "females_metadata_sub.csv".


5) List all of the file in your current directory. Navigate up one directory and then delete your "new_dir" with all of the files in it.
