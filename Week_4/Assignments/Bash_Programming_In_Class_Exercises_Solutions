Bash Programming In Class Exercises

In the Data directory for this week, I have provided you with a file called "pseudo_metadata.csv". This file creates some fake meta data for a small study of 10 participants. 

1) Count how many lines are in this file.

wc -l "/Users/f002yt8/Documents/GitHub/HDS-Foundations_of_Data_Science/Week_4/Data/pseudo_metadata.csv"

2) Subset this data frame to contain only the female participants and write out that meta data to a file called "only_female.txt".

awk -F, 'NR==1 || $5=="\"F\""'  /Users/f002yt8/Documents/GitHub/HDS-Foundations_of_Data_Science/Week_4/Data/pseudo_metadata.csv >  /Users/f002yt8/Documents/GitHub/HDS-Foundations_of_Data_Science/Week_4/Data/females_metadata.csv

3) Make a new directory called "new_dir". Copy the "females_metadata.csv" into your new directory. Make a new file called "notes.txt" in this directory. Write a few notes on the data in the "females_metadata.csv".

mkdir -p /Users/f002yt8/Documents/GitHub/HDS-Foundations_of_Data_Science/Week_4/Data/new_dir

cd /Users/f002yt8/Documents/GitHub/HDS-Foundations_of_Data_Science/Week_4/Data/new_dir

cp /Users/f002yt8/Documents/GitHub/HDS-Foundations_of_Data_Science/Week_4/Data/females_metadata.csv /Users/f002yt8/Documents/GitHub/HDS-Foundations_of_Data_Science/Week_4/Data/new_dir/females_metadata.csv

touch /Users/f002yt8/Documents/GitHub/HDS-Foundations_of_Data_Science/Week_4/Data/new_dir/notes.txt

echo "These are my notes." > notes.txt

4) Isolate the third and fourth columns in the data frame and write that out to a new file called "females_metadata_sub.csv".

cut -d',' -f3,4 /Users/f002yt8/Documents/GitHub/HDS-Foundations_of_Data_Science/Week_4/Data/new_dir/females_metadata.csv >> /Users/f002yt8/Documents/GitHub/HDS-Foundations_of_Data_Science/Week_4/Data/new_dir/females_metadata_sub.csv

5) List all of the file in your current directory. Navigate up one directory and then delete your "new_dir" with all of the files in it.

ls
cd ../
rm -rf new_dir
